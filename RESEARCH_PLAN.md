## Epics & Tasks

### Epic 1: Data Pipeline 🔄 IN PROGRESS
Core data infrastructure for partisan lean measurement.
**Scripts**: `scripts/01_data_prep/`, `scripts/02_partisan_lean/`, `scripts/03_entity_resolution/`
**Detailed plan**: `docs/plans/data_pipeline_plan.md`

#### Phase 1: POI-Level Partisan Lean (NEEDS CLEANUP)
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 Partisan lean computation | ✅ Done | 79 months, 596M POI-month rows. Weighted avg of CBG election results by visitor origin. |
| 1.2 Extract normalized visits | ✅ Done | 2,096 raw Advan files → extracted `normalized_visits_by_state_scaling` column |
| 1.3 Join normalized visits | ✅ Done | Merged normalized visits into partisan lean data (79 monthly parquet files) |
| 1.3b Filter to US states only | ⬚ Pending | **BUG**: Data includes Canadian provinces (AB, BC, MB, etc.) and US territories (AS, GU, MP, PR, VI). Filter to 50 US states + DC only. Requires re-running aggregation. |
| 1.3c Fix multi-brand POI names | ⬚ Pending | **BUG**: Some POIs (esp. auto dealers) have comma-separated brand lists as names (e.g., "Dodge,Chrysler,Lincoln,Ford"). Need to either split, match to parent company, or flag as multi-brand. |
| 1.3d Investigate missing major brands | ⬚ Pending | **BUG**: Target stores missing (only Target Optical exists). Check if other major retailers are missing from Advan brand data. |
| 1.3e Fix entity resolution failures | ⬚ Pending | **BUG**: Entity resolution producing garbage matches for multi-brand POIs (e.g., "Chevrolet,Volkswagen,Toyota" → "Société Générale SA"). Review matching quality, add validation rules for multi-brand names. |

#### Phase 2: National Brands (COMPLETE - NEEDS RERUN)
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1.4 Entity resolution (national brands) | ✅ Done | Matched 3,872 Advan brands → companies (gvkey, ticker, rcid). 1.48M POIs covered. |
| 1.5a Aggregate to brand × month | ✅ Done | 273K brand-months, 3,543 brands. Weighted avg using normalized_visits. Output: `brand_month_partisan_lean.parquet` |

**⚠️ DEPENDENCY**: Phase 2 outputs need to be regenerated after Phase 1 bugs (1.3b-1.3e) are fixed. Current outputs include Canadian provinces, multi-brand garbage matches, and missing major retailers.

#### Phase 3: Singletons / Unbranded POIs (IN PROGRESS - BLOCKED)
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1.6 POI → MSA mapping | ✅ Done | 6.31M POIs mapped to 366 MSAs via CBG crosswalk |
| 1.7 Aggregate to name × MSA × month | ⬚ Pending | Group unbranded POIs by (poi_name, msa, year_month). Preserves `total_normalized_visits` for later rollup. |
| 1.8 (Optional) Link to PAW for cross-MSA rollup | ⬚ Pending | If PAW identifies same company across MSAs, can re-aggregate using preserved weights. See Epic 6. |

**⚠️ DEPENDENCY**: Phase 3 is blocked until Phase 1 bugs (1.3b-1.3e) are fixed. Singleton aggregation would inherit the same data quality issues (Canadian provinces, multi-brand POIs).

#### Phase 4: Documentation
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1.9 Document aggregation methodology | ⬚ Pending | LaTeX appendix: data sources, filters (95% pct_visitors_matched), weighted avg formula, singleton approach |

**Singleton aggregation approach**: We aggregate unbranded POIs by `name + MSA` (not requiring PAW). This avoids systematic exclusion of businesses not in PAW (small businesses, sole proprietors). We preserve `total_normalized_visits` at each level so that if PAW later identifies the same company across multiple MSAs, we can correctly re-aggregate. See `docs/plans/singleton_aggregation_plan.md` for details.

### Epic 2: Validation (Schoenmueller Comparison) ✅ COMPLETE
Validate our measure against external benchmarks.
**Scripts**: `scripts/04_validation/`

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 2.1 Load Schoenmueller data | ✅ Done | 1,289 brands, Rep 0.04-0.98 |
| 2.2 Match brands to Schoenmueller | ✅ Done | Semantic embeddings (text-embedding-3-large) + Jaro-Winkler + manual verification. 1,036 candidate pairs → 662 TRUE matches, 374 FALSE. Final sample: 283 brands with foot traffic data. |
| 2.3 Correlation analysis | ✅ Done | **r=0.27, p<0.001, ρ=0.40**. National brands (31+ states): r=0.32. Regional: r=0.21. Local: r=0.18 (n.s.). |
| 2.4 Divergence analysis | ✅ Done | Twitter extremity explains divergence (r=0.72). Trump properties most divergent (92% R Twitter vs 36% R foot traffic). High-traffic brands align well. |
| 2.5 Generate validation outputs | ✅ Done | Scatter plot PNG/PDF in `outputs/validation/` and `paper/figures/` |
| 2.6 Generate LaTeX table rows | ✅ Done | Full 283-brand comparison table for appendix |
| 2.7 Document matching methodology | ✅ Done | LaTeX appendix updated with methodology, stats, conclusion |

*Note: Sample Attrition subsection added to appendix explaining the matching funnel (694→179→133 losses from Schoenmueller sample to final matched sample).*

**Key finding**: Moderate convergent validity. Twitter captures performative political consumption (self-selection); foot traffic captures routine commercial behavior. Measures correlate positively but are not interchangeable.

### Epic 3: Descriptive Analysis 🟡 PARTIALLY READY
Document patterns in consumer partisan lean.
**Scripts**: `scripts/05_descriptive/`
**Website plan**: `docs/plans/brand_explorer_website_plan.md`

**Key features** (per interview 2026-01-20):
- **Landing page**: Featured household name brands (McDonald's, Walmart, etc.)
- **Brand search & profiles**: Search ~3,500 brands, time series with user-selectable granularity
- **Interactive POI map**: Three view modes (absolute lean, relative to local, relative to brand avg)
- **MSA analysis**: Choropleth map, compare brands within same MSA
- **Rankings**: Most Republican / Democratic brands
- **Access**: Password-protected, request-based data downloads

*Depends on: Task 1.5a (brand-month data) ✅, POI coordinates (3.7a in progress)*

### Epic 4: Store Performance (SafeGraph Spend) 🟡 PARTIALLY READY
Link partisan lean to business outcomes using SafeGraph Spend.
**Scripts**: `scripts/06_performance/`

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 4.1 Explore SafeGraph Spend | ✅ Done | 83 months, 93% POI overlap |
| 4.2 Match to partisan lean | ⬚ Pending | Join on PLACEKEY |
| 4.3 Within-store TWFE | ⬚ Pending | Spending ~ lean × salience |
| 4.4 Event studies | ⬚ Pending | Elections, Dobbs, etc. |
| 4.5 Document performance methods | ⬚ Pending | LaTeX appendix: SafeGraph Spend join, TWFE spec |

*Can start with national brands. Full coverage needs singletons (Task 1.7).*

### Epic 5: Excess Partisan Lean (Gravity Model) 🟡 PARTIALLY READY
Control for geography using gravity model.
**Scripts**: `scripts/07_causal/` (gravity model)

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 5.1 Build gravity model | ⬚ Pending | Distance decay, population |
| 5.2 Category-specific parameters | ⬚ Pending | NAICS 4-digit |
| 5.3 Compute expected lean | ⬚ Pending | From gravity predictions |
| 5.4 Calculate excess lean | ⬚ Pending | Actual - expected |
| 5.5 Document gravity model | ⬚ Pending | LaTeX appendix: model spec, distance decay, category params |

*Can prototype with national brands. Full geographic coverage needs singletons (Task 1.7).*

### Epic 6: Employee-Consumer Alignment 🔄 IN PROGRESS
Link consumer partisan lean to Politics at Work employee ideology data.
**Scripts**: `scripts/07_causal/`
**Detailed plan**: `docs/plans/entity_resolution_paw_linkage.md`

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 6.0a PAW Company × MSA table | ✅ Done | 4.1M companies, 366 MSAs. Source: Politics at Work voter registration + employment records. |
| 6.0b POI → MSA mapping | ✅ Done | 6.31M POIs mapped to 366 MSAs via CBG crosswalk. |
| 6.1a Singleton pilot (Columbus OH) | ✅ Done | Phases 1-4 complete. 1.9M candidate pairs, logit model trained. |
| 6.1b National singleton matching | 🔄 Running | Jobs 31710527-29 submitted (350 MSAs, ~$13.32). 335 MSAs complete. |
| 6.1c Bigmem retry (large MSAs) | 🔄 Running | Job 31729938 (savio3_bigmem). NYC, LA, Chicago, etc. 2 of 11 tasks still running. |
| 6.1d Tiered entity resolution | 🔄 Running | Job 31729937. Ticker-first strategy for brand → PAW matching. |

| 6.4 Alignment correlation | ⬚ Pending | Correlate employee partisan lean with consumer partisan lean at company level. |

*Depends on: Epic 1 completion (especially Task 1.7 for singletons)*

**PAW coverage limitation**: PAW only includes companies with employees who have voter registration records. This systematically excludes sole proprietors, very small businesses, and businesses with unregistered employees. We document this as a limitation and note that the name×MSA aggregation in Epic 1 provides broader coverage for consumer-side analysis.

### Epic 7: Causal Identification (Later Phase) ⬚ NOT STARTED

## Key Methodology

### Brand Aggregation
Use `normalized_visits_by_state_scaling` as weights:
```
brand_lean = Σ(rep_lean_i × normalized_visits_i) / Σ(normalized_visits_i)
```

### Excess Partisan Lean
Gravity model with NAICS 4-digit categories:
```
excess_lean = actual_lean - expected_lean_from_gravity
```

---

## Deprioritized

- **Option G (Temporal)**: Data starts 2019, misses 2016 polarization
- **Option L (Reviews)**: Lower priority, high effort
